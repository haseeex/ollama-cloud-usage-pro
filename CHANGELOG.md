# Changelog

All notable changes to the Ollama Cloud Usage extension.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-08-19

### Changed
- Reset windows now UTC-anchored: session on 5h boundaries (00/05/10/15/20 UTC), weekly on Monday 00:00 UTC. Replaces the previous 11:00-local heuristic.
- Status bar: single item, click opens detail panel. Removed double-click and separate refresh button.
- Auto-refresh interval reduced from 5 minutes to 60 seconds.
- Usage panel bars split into per-model segments, each a distinct blue shade (by index). Removed the green/yellow/red severity coloring.
- Model list follows API order; per-model request count shown (hover bar segment for model name + count).
- Tooltip shows quota table with per-model share bars and reset countdowns.

### Fixed
- Reset time no longer depends on local timezone / DST.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- Session 5h reset time: now anchored to 11:00 today with a rolling 5h window (matches Ollama's actual reset behavior) instead of fixed hourly slots.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- README screenshots now use absolute GitHub raw URLs so images render on the marketplace and web.

### Added
